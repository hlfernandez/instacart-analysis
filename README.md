# Instacart Analysis
_A data analysis and customer segmentation project_

This project has three main components: a basic analysis/EDA, a hypothesis test, and a customer segmentation, all focused on data from [Instacart (via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview).  

Files in this repo:
* **instacart-analysis.ipynb**: a Jupyter Notebook containing project code.
* **welch_functions.py**: functions for conducting Welch's t-test.

The customer segmentation portion of this project was inspired by [this Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-important-data-science-tool-for-market-and-customer-segmentation-c9709ca0b64a) and [this repo](https://github.com/optiflow/rfm-customer-segmentation) by Tern Poh Lim.
